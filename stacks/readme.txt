Stacks are most popular Data Structures. In general as day to day example, stack is considered as stack of books where when you add new book to stack, it will be inserted in last and when we remove item from stack last item will be removed from stack, last item stack will be removed. Basically last-in first-out (LIFO). Basic datasctructure Arrays can be used as Stacks and we can also implement own stacks without using Arrays.
